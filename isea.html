                The topic of my project is about Techno-sex, specifically regarding the question: “How are techno-sex, women’s rights campaigns and online sexuality contributing to the fields and ideologies of social networks?”. I want to focus on women’s rights especially regarding women who have been sexually harassed or abused - either online or in person. This is an issue that is not openly discussed and many women who are victims do not usually speak up. The main goals of this project are to provide an online resource that can be used to help female victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse and to provide an online resource that can educate non-victims and promote awareness of this issue. </p>
            <p>
                For victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse, there needs to be a resource that they can use to reach out for help. There are many resources out there that people may not be aware of. There also needs to be a way to assure the victim that things will be okay - a way to assure their safety and to provide help for them.</p>
            <p>
                To help promote awareness and educate others, there will be interactive infographics on the site. Not only will it be fun and interactive, but it will be educational so that it can be effective in boosting awareness of this issue. Using visual pleasing aesthetics to attract users and fun interactions to keep them interested, users who are non-victims can learn more regarding this topic and by learning more then can help put an end to this issue. </p>
