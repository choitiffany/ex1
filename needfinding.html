        <p> I used my roommate for user research. Some notable things she mentioned was that there were "too many things jumping out at me". She studies human development and mentioned how if she were a victim, she wouldn't know what to do on the site. She mentioned how there needs to be an emphasis on how to help (for non-victims) and a way to assure victims that things will be okay. </p>
