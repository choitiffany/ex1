            <ul>
                <li>through reading the stories</li>
                <li>but... will they understand the purpose? should we insert a CTA?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Objective to post stories and read: intuitive buttons and navigation</li>
                <li>Objective to learn and take responsibility for social issues: through an about page, with a CTA</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>  What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stories, in the form of images, text and possibly videos</li>
                <li>Interface to share stories</li>
                <li>Filter abilities, based on relevance, number of views, location</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
            How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you or your team is creating?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tech-savy users will have an easy time using the interface as they will have experience with existing social media platforms. Our interface, however, will be simple and clear enough for inexperienced users to understand.</li>
                <li>Users will expect our interface to be intuitive and understandable. They will also expect the focus of our website to be on the stories.</li>
            </ul>
