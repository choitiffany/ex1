                The library I was was <a href="http://www.chartjs.org/"> chart.js </a>. It allows for the creation of animated and itneractive charts to create visually pleasing infographics. It's faily simple to use because the site lists detailed documentation on the different uses and functions that you cand o with it. There are also lots of helpful resources - such as Youtube tutorials (which I used) and other online articles - to help create charts. These charts are animated when first opened and come with tool tips. It's a very simple and easy way to create graphs. There are a lot of ways to change and alter the details of the graph that I haven't discovered yet. </p>

            <p> For this exercise, I illustrated five different objects in my bag. The image of the object is an outlined white silhouette of the object so that when you hover over the objects the actual color of the object shows. Another feature is that when you hover over the object, text slides down from the top of the box it's in. I really wanted to find a unique way to show the text because I felt like there was a little something I wanted to say about each item that I had. I didn't have any text appear so that the user would be curious about the objects and want to learn more about the items.</p>

            <p> In this exercise, I created a site that allowed users to interact with the page in order to visually see where I spend most of my time on a typical day. I am usually either at home, on the go, in Cruess, or somewhere else on campus. It includes buttons that shows my opinions about each location when you hover over it (tool tips). When the user selects the button, it gives a detailed list all the times I was at that location and why. The timeline at the bottom also gets filled up in relation to which location was selected. After you click all the buttons you can see the entire list of times I was at a certain place. Using both the list and the timeline, you can see where I spend most of my time.</p>

            Based on the Bill Dercouchey's <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/billder/learning-ixd-from-everyday-objects/"><strong> article </strong></a>.

            <p> For PIXEL, I often create the Facebook events so I fill out the form to create the events a lot. The order you fill out the form is the same order the information for the event will be listed in the event page. The hierarchy of the information has the image displayed first to grab the user's attention, then list small but important details, before introducing the main text. The information that you input is very clear and easy to understand and complete. It provides small details as tips on creating the event. As an avid user of this form, the frustrating part about it is how it is a popup window from the Facebook page because I often want to refer to past Facebook events but I can't do that because this form is open. The button to publish the event is in blue and stands out so that it is clear for the user to navigate what the next step of the form is.</p>

            <p> Uber is a transportation service that is most commonly used through a mobile app. Uber is a company that values design and it is reflected in the interface of their website. The website <strong><a href="http://www.uber.com">(uber.com)</a> </strong>is well designed, visually pleasing, and also easy to navigate in order to get to whatever it is you're looking for. The minimalist design of the page makes information easy to access. The homepage is one page with infinite scrolling that shows the benefits of their app, different options for rides, and other unique features.</p>
            <p> One of the unique features of the site is with its interaction design that can be shown in the section that shows the different features of the app. When you hover over the image, the dark square slides up to reveal the image for you to also click. This unique component makes the website fun to interact with.</p>

            <p>I think this website is very effective in communicating the information of its services to customers. When I was studying abroad, I was looking for different methods of transportation from the airport in London to my hotel and Uber's website clearly listed the different rates and various options for cars, making it easy for me to plan out my trip and find the information I was looking for.</p>
