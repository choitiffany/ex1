            <hr> ISEA: Techno-sex How are techno-sex, women’s rights campaigns and online sexuality contributing to the fields and ideologies of social networks?
            <br>
            <br> Social Media has helped with the movement of women’s rights campaigns get their message out. It has helped provide a platform for women to share their stories and sexual experiences. HarassMap is a website started in Egypt that allows women to anonymously report experiences of sexual harassment and their location. This creates a map that documents locations of sexual harassment, revealing trends in regards to the location and also just revealing the amount of sexual harassment that occurs. Projects such as HarassMap and others allow women to share their experiences online in an effort to inform people and push for women’s rights. However, not all women have access to such technologies either.

            <br>
            <br> ISEA: New Media and Cultural Heritage How can new media meaningfully support scholarly, archival, and educational practices involving cultural heritage?
            <br>
            <br> With the advancement and popularization of new media, many companies have been working with new media to its advantage to encourage the preservation and exploration of cultural heritages. An app called COOLTURA was developed to make cultural heritage more interesting and interactive. It uses the user’s smartphone to access their location and time to provide “personalised up-to-date and interactive cultural heritage content, in real time.” This allows users, especially those who are travelling, to learn more about a culture with the usage of today’s technology. It also encourages people to go out and explore as well push them to participate more in cultural events and experiences. Another app called Stedr allows users to share their stories and experiences related to a certain place. It is like digital storytelling but more personal in relation to a specific place or culture. This helps preserve cultural heritage while exposing and sharing it with others.
            <br>
            <br> Artists have also been using new media to create their work but some also use it as a way to create artwork that also preserves and share their cultural heritage. Artists Geronimo Inutiq created the piece ARCTICNOISE which includes imagery and sound from a documentary about Canada. He seeks to create a conversation to his viewers about his identity because he is not just Canadian. His mother is Inuit and his father is French-Canadian. He hopes that through his piece, other artists will be open to exploring their identities as well with the usage of new media. Aside from the preservation of cultural heritage, there are also issues regarding identity when it comes to people of different heritages.
